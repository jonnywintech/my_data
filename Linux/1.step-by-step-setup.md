After you got access for new server. 
It is good practice to create new user for each new application you use on server

create new user as root
```bash
adduser <username>
```

add user details if nessesary
add that user to sudo group
```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo <username>
```

afther that if you use ssh to login with rsa

copy content of current ssh  public key located  in ~/.ssh/some-file-name.pub
and paste content into server 
```bash
nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
and paste key here

for example if you are using multiple pc for logging in via ssh you can paste multiple public keys in here. separate them with blank line and write comment about key if nessesary if you are working with multiple people on server.

bash script for installing  LAMP stack
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Apache
sudo apt install apache2 -y

# Install MySQL
sudo apt install mysql-server -y

# Secure MySQL
sudo mysql_secure_installation

# Install PHP and common extensions
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql php-cli php-curl php-zip php-gd php-mbstring php-xml php-bcmath php-soap -y

# Restart Apache
sudo systemctl restart apache2

# Check versions
apache2 -v
php -v
mysql --version

```

check system with fastfetch
```bash
sudo apt install fastfetch
```

if swap needed

```bash
sudo fallocate -l 1G /swapfile  
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=1048576  
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile  
sudo mkswap /swapfile  
sudo swapon /swapfile  
sudo nano /etc/fstab  
```

`/swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0`


Setup of MYSQL

Login as root user
```bash
sudo mysql -uroot
```

`Change text between <>  and '' accordingly to your needs`

Create database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE <database name>
```

Create new user
```sql
CREATE USER 'myuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword';
```

Give privileges to that user on specific database
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON your_database_name.* TO 'myuser'@'localhost';
```

Grant user access to all databases
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'myuser'@'localhost';
```

Apply changes !!!
```sql
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Exit
```sql
EXIT;
```

Alternative for remote login `Replace localhost with % if you want the user to connect remotely (not recommended unless secured properly):`
```sql
CREATE USER 'myuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword';
```

Check privileges
```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'myuser'@'localhost';
```
