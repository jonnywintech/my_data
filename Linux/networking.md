# Networking


ip adress have 32 bits. every dot is splited by binary number ranging from 0 to 255


Local network

subnet range  subnet mask

192.168.0.0 > 255.255.255.0

example range               fixed first 3 dots cannot change 192.168.0

192.168.0.0 > 255.255.255.0 > 192.168.0.x/255 -  last digit it can be up until 255

2 fixated ranges

192.168.0.0 > 255.255.0.0  > 192.168.x.x/255./255
